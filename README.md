# Apps Privacy Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes network traffic of Android apps to study their compliance with privacy controls and rules, focusing on the use of the Advertising Identifier (ADID) and the impact of the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal.

## Key Features

- Extract domains from HAR files
- Analyze network traffic under different privacy settings
- Detect ADID usage in network requests
- Generate domain contact statistics per app and condition
- Visualize results using charts and graphs
- Create Venn diagrams to compare domains across privacy settings

## Output

- Detailed domain analysis results in CSV format
- Lists of domains contacted by each app
- Bar plots showing top domains and domain count distributions
- Comparative charts of domain contacts under different privacy conditions
- Venn diagrams illustrating common and unique domains across privacy settings
- CSV file of unique domains for each privacy condition

Note: The data used in this analysis is confidential and not publicly available. Therefore, the code cannot be run without access to the original dataset.
